### PROJECT SETUP GUIDE

NOTE: PROJECT SETUP GUIDE (IF YOU WANT TO CLONE THE REPO IN THE LOCAL SYSTEM)

**React Project Setup:**

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   - Clone the project repository using Git:
     git clone <repository_url>
   - To get the repository_url: : <a href="https://github.com/Dimension-1/Marketeers">Click Here</a>

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**: 
   - Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the cloned project directory:
     ```
     cd <project_directory>
     ```
   - Replace `<project_directory>` with the name of the directory created during cloning.

3. **Install Dependencies**: 
   - The project uses npm:
     ```
     npm install
     ```

4. **Start Development Server**: 
   - Start the development server:
     ```
     npm start
     ```

5. **View the Application**: 
   - Once the server starts, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or another specified port) to view the React application.

6. **Additional Setup for Animation, Data Fetching, and Swiper.js**:
   - For animation using Framer Motion, data fetching with Axios, and implementing sliders with Swiper.js, ensure that these dependencies are already included in your `package.json` file.
   - You may need to import and configure these libraries in your React components according to their respective documentation.
   - For Swiper.js, make sure to follow the setup instructions provided in the Swiper.js documentation to initialize and customize your sliders.
